API Overview
************
The Traffic Ops API provides programmatic access to read and write CDN data providing authorized API consumers with the ability to monitor CDN performance and configure CDN settings and parameters.

Response Structure
------------------
All successful responses have the following structure: ::

    {
      "response": <JSON object with main response>,
    }

To make the documentation easier to read, only the ``<JSON object with main response>`` is documented, even though the response and version fields are always present. 

Using API Endpoints
-------------------
1. Authenticate with your Traffic Portal or Traffic Ops user account credentials.
2. Upon successful user authentication, note the mojolicious cookie value in the response headers. 
3. Pass the mojolicious cookie value, along with any subsequent calls to an authenticated API endpoint.

Example: ::
  
    [jvd@laika ~]$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:3000/api/1.1/usage/asns.json
    {"alerts":[{"level":"error","text":"Unauthorized, please log in."}]}
    [jvd@laika ~]$
    [jvd@laika ~]$ curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" -v -X POST --data '{ "u":"admin", "p":"secret_passwd" }' http://localhost:3000/api/1.1/user/login

  The rest of the API documentation will only document the ``200 OK`` case, where no errors have occured.
