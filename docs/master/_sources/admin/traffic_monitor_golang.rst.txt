Configuring Traffic Monitor
===========================

Configuration Overview
----------------------

.. _rl-tm-configure:

Traffic Monitor is configured via two JSON configuration files, ``traffic_ops.cfg`` and ``traffic_monitor.cfg``, by default located in the ``conf`` directory in the install location.

The ``traffic_ops.cfg`` config contains Traffic Ops connection information. Specify the URL, username, and password for the instance of Traffic Ops for which this Traffic Monitor is a member.

The ``traffic_monitor.cfg`` config contains log file locations, as well as detailed application configuration variables, such as processing flush times and initial poll intervals.

Once started with the correct configuration, Traffic Monitor downloads its configuration from Traffic Ops and begins polling caches. Once every cache has been polled, health protocol state is available via RESTful JSON endpoints.


Troubleshooting and log files
=============================
Traffic Monitor log files are in ``/opt/traffic_monitor/var/log/``.
