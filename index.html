    Apache Traffic Control (incubating) allows you to build a large scale content delivery network using open source. Built around <a href="http://trafficserver.apache.org">Apache Traffic Server</a> as the caching software, Traffic Control implements all the core functions of a modern CDN:

By using consistent hashing it sends requests for the same content to the same cache in a group of caches working together in a location. It takes care of routing clients around hot spots and problems in the CDN by using the information from Traffic Monitor with regards to state of all the caches.

					Apache Traffic Control is an effort undergoing Incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Incubator. 
					Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 
					While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
